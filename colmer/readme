What did you like about this project?

It helped me review what I learned thus far.

What did you struggle with in this project?

My insomnia relapsed so I need to go to my dr as soon as class ended yesterday and it took the entire day. Only being able to work on the project for 3 hours from scratch and with lack of sleep was really challenging. I decided to forgo certain attributes that I coult easily find out on my own just to save time. I am quite unsatisfied with the end product but I am also incredibly tired and ready to sleep.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?

Honestly, if I just managed to sleep properly these past few days it would be a lot better already.

P.S.

Sorry for the messy code my brain is a mess.
